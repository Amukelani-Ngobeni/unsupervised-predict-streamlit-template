# App Overview
---
Data is a critical component in building accurate and robust recommendation systems that will be able to recommend movies that a user would most likely love to watch. In the development of this application, we have used historical data about movies and interactive information such as ratings left by users. We have noted that recommender systems fall short with recommendations for new users. It is for this reason that we have developed an algorithm that uses a content based and a collaborative filtering method to make reliable movie recommendations.


The content based filtering relies heavily on the properties of the movies in the datasets used to train the prediction model. The application developed relies primarily on the genres of the movies to find similarities between movies. The collaborative filtering works best for users that have viewed and rated movies previously as it relies on the interaction the user would have had with the movies in the data set.


The application developed thus returns to the user a list of the top 10 recommended movies, provided they have watched at least three movies. The user can select the method or type of recommender (be it content based or collaborative).


The application also goes further to explain how the solution was developed. This is done to give the end user a better understanding of what the application does. 


The application created will help consumers find movies that they would like to watch; that of which will result in revenue generation for the providers of the movies. Consumers can also filter their search to find movies from their favourite genres,actors,genres and years

Additionally the application helps companies find insights in the movie data. This can be leveraged to create content which is highly likely to be successful. This can further improve revenue as the company can provide exclusive content which they know is likey to do well according to user behaviour and properties of popular movies
