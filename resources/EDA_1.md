In todayâ€™s technology driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can make appropriate choices surrounding the content they engage with on a daily basis. One application where this is especially true surrounds movie content recommendations; where intelligent algorithms can help viewers find great titles from tens of thousands of options.

With this context, EDSA has challenged us to construct a recommendation algorithm based on content or collaborative filtering, capable of accurately predicting how a user will rate a movie they have not yet viewed based on their historical preferences.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being exposed to content they would like to view or purchase - generating revenue and platform affinity.

**Data Overview**

**This dataset consists of several million 5-star ratings obtained from users of the online MovieLens movie recommendation service.** The MovieLens dataset has long been used by industry and academic researchers to improve the performance of explicitly-based recommender systems, and now you get to as well!


There are a total of **45,466 movies** with **24 features**. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
### Title and Overview Wordclouds
We will have a look at the title and the given plot words to determine if there are recurring words or words that are more common in both the way movies get titles and also how movies tend to be described.


Figure 1.1: The word **Love** is the most commonly used word in movie titles.  **Man** is also a very common word, and this is closely followed by **Girl** which makes for an interesting thought on gender representation in film. Love is perhaps so common because romance is often present in movies of all genres. 

Figure 1.2: Looking at the plot keywords, there seems to be a lot of emphasis on nudity. When it comes to locations, New York is the popular city. reference, character, female, rated, murder and word title are other words that pop out.
