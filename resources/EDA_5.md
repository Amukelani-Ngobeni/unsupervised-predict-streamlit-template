### Movie Release Dates

Release Dates can often play a very important role in determining the success and the revenue generated by a particular movie. In this section, we will try and gain insights about release dates in terms of years, months and days of the week. 

We have already constructed the **year** feature in our preliminary data wrangling step. Let us now extract the month and day too for each movie with a release date.

#### Number of Movies by the year

The Dataset of 45,000 movies available to us does not represent the entire corpus of movies released since the inception of cinema. However, it is reasomnable to assume that it does include almost every major film released in Hollywood as well as other major film industries across the world (such as Bollywood in India). With this assumption in mind, let us take a look at the number of movies produced by the year.


Figure 5: We notice that there is a sharp rise in the number of movies **starting the 1990s decade.** However, we will not look too much into this as it is entirely possible that recent movies were oversampled for the purposes of this dataset.
